# Final-Project
Exploring the Gender Pay Gap Across Industries

## Project Overview
Despite progress towards gender equality in the workplace, significant disparities in pay between men and women persist across various industries. Understanding the factors contributing to these disparities is essential for addressing the gender pay gap effectively. The gender pay gap impacts economic stability and personal well-being for many individuals. Addressing it can lead to a more equitable workforce and improved societal outcomes.

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies

To ensure that you have all the dependencies installed, and that we can have a reproducible environment, we will be using `pipenv` to manage our dependencies. `pipenv` is a tool that allows us to create a virtual environment for our project, and install all the dependencies we need for our project. This ensures that we can have a reproducible environment, and that we can all run the same code.

```bash
pipenv install
```

This sets up a virtual environment for our project, and installs the following dependencies:

- `ipykernel`
- `jupyter`
- `notebook`
- `black`
  Throughout your analysis and development, you will need to install additional packages. You can can install any package you need using `pipenv install <package-name>`. For example, if you need to install `numpy`, you can do so by running:

```bash
pipenv install numpy
```

This will update update the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files, and install the package in your virtual environment.

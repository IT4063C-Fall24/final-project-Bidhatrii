# Final-Project
Exploring the Gender Pay Gap Across Industries

## Project Overview
Despite progress towards gender equality in the workplace, significant disparities in pay between men and women persist across various industries. Understanding the factors contributing to these disparities is essential for addressing the gender pay gap effectively. The gender pay gap impacts economic stability and personal well-being for many individuals. Addressing it can lead to a more equitable workforce and improved societal outcomes.

### Reflection
<!-- Edit the following section with your reflection -->

#### What went well?
The project went well in terms of exploring the gender pay gap across various industries using the provided datasets. The data was cleaned and preprocessed efficiently, and I was able to create clear, informative visuals such as bar charts, scatter plots, and box plots that effectively communicated the relationships between gender, salary, experience, and education level.

#### What did not go well?
While the project was mostly successful, there were challenges in ensuring that the data was completely clean and formatted consistently across both datasets. Missing values in certain columns required extra attention, and there were occasional inconsistencies in how job titles and education levels were recorded. Additionally, some of the visualizations became cluttered when there were too many job titles or categories, making them hard to interpret at a glance.

#### What did you learn?
I learned how to apply various data analysis techniques to explore complex societal issues like the gender pay gap. The process of cleaning and merging multiple datasets helped me improve my skills in data preprocessing and handling missing values. I also gained experience in creating meaningful visualizations using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to better communicate insights. 

#### What would you do differently next time?
Next time, I would spend more time cleaning the data to ensure consistency, especially in categorical variables like job titles and education levels. Additionally, I would explore more advanced machine learning models to predict the pay gap based on features like experience and education level.

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies

To ensure that you have all the dependencies installed, and that we can have a reproducible environment, we will be using `pipenv` to manage our dependencies. `pipenv` is a tool that allows us to create a virtual environment for our project, and install all the dependencies we need for our project. This ensures that we can have a reproducible environment, and that we can all run the same code.

```bash
pipenv install
```

This sets up a virtual environment for our project, and installs the following dependencies:

- `ipykernel`
- `jupyter`
- `notebook`
- `black`
  Throughout your analysis and development, you will need to install additional packages. You can can install any package you need using `pipenv install <package-name>`. For example, if you need to install `numpy`, you can do so by running:

```bash
pipenv install numpy
```

This will update update the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files, and install the package in your virtual environment.

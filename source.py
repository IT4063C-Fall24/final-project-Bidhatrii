# 
# ![Banner](./assets/banner.jpeg)

# ## Topic
# *What problem are you (or your stakeholder) trying to address?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# Despite progress towards gender equality in the workplace, significant disparities in pay between men and women persist across various industries. Understanding the factors contributing to these disparities is essential for addressing the gender pay gap effectively.
# 
# The gender pay gap impacts economic stability and personal well-being for many individuals. Addressing it can lead to a more equitable workforce and improved societal outcomes.
# 
# 

# ## Project Question
# *What specific question are you seeking to answer with this project?*
# *This is not the same as the questions you ask to limit the scope of the project.*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# -What is the average salary difference between men and women in various industries?
# -How do education levels and years of experience correlate with the gender pay gap?
# -Are there specific industries where the gender pay gap is more pronounced?
# -What role do company diversity and inclusion initiatives play in mitigating the pay gap?

# ## What would an answer look like?
# *What is your hypothesized answer to your question?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# -Visual representations such as bar charts comparing average salaries by gender across industries.
# -Scatter plots correlating years of experience and education level with salary differences.
# -A summary of findings highlighting industries with significant disparities and potential factors influencing these gaps.

# ## Data Sources
# *What 3 data sources have you identified for this project?*
# *How are you going to relate these datasets?*
# 
# ->Glassdoor Gender Pay Gap.csv
# This dataset provides insights into income disparities based on job titles and gender. By analyzing the base pay and bonuses for various job titles, you can identify specific roles where the gender pay gap is most significant. The demographic data (age, education, seniority) included in this dataset allows for a deeper exploration of how these factors correlate with salary differences.
# 
# ->inc_occ_gender.csv
# This dataset from the Bureau of Labor Statistics offers median weekly incomes segmented by occupation and sex. It can be used to compare and validate findings from the Glassdoor dataset, especially in understanding industry-wide trends in gender pay gaps. The data on total median income and the breakdown by gender will help highlight industries with pronounced disparities.
# 
# ->Salary_Data.csv
# This dataset consolidates information on age, experience, education level, and salary across various roles. It will serve as a comprehensive source to correlate individual characteristics (such as education and experience) with salary differences. By merging this data with the previous two datasets, you can create a more holistic view of the gender pay gap, examining how personal attributes impact salary in conjunction with industry-specific trends.
# 
# Merging by Job Title and Gender: All three datasets contain job title and gender as key attributes. You can merge them to analyze salary differences within specific roles across various industries.
# 
# Comparative Analysis: Use the Glassdoor dataset to explore salary structures within specific job titles and then validate these findings with the broader industry data from the BLS dataset. This comparison will highlight whether the trends observed in specific job titles reflect wider industry patterns.
# 
# Correlational Studies: Use the Salary_Data dataset to perform statistical analyses, such as regression or correlation, to investigate how years of experience and education levels interact with the gender pay gap identified in the other datasets. This will enable you to provide a more nuanced understanding of the factors influencing salary disparities.

# In[76]:


# Group by 'Gender' and calculate descriptive statistics for the specified columns
gender_stats = df.groupby('Gender')[['BasePay', 'Bonus', 'TotalSalary']].describe()

# Print the result

# ## Updated Approach:
# We can group the data by both JobTitle and Education, then calculate the average BasePay for each combination of these two features, split by Gender. This will give a better understanding of how gender pay disparities are influenced by both job role and educational background.
# 
# Group by JobTitle, Education, and Gender: We're calculating the average BasePay for each combination of JobTitle, Education, and Gender. This allows for a more granular view of the gender pay gap, considering both the job title and education level.
# 
# Pivot Table: We create a pivot table with JobTitle and Education as the index and Gender as columns. This structure makes it easy to compare the average pay for males and females within each job and education category.
# 
# 

# In[80]:


# Grouping by JobTitle, Education, and Gender, and calculating the mean BasePay
data = df.groupby(['JobTitle', 'Education', 'Gender']).agg({'BasePay': 'mean'}).reset_index()

# Pivoting the table to make JobTitle and Education as index, Gender as columns
pivot_data = data.pivot_table(index=['JobTitle', 'Education'], columns='Gender', values='BasePay')

# Calculating the pay gap between Male and Female
pivot_data['PayGap'] = pivot_data['Male'] - pivot_data['Female']

# Sorting by PayGap for better visualization
pivot_data_sorted = pivot_data.sort_values(by='PayGap', ascending=False)

# Display the result
